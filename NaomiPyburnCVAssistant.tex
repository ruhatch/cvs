  % I am a British young professional with experience working in early-stage startups. I'm eager to learn more about launching tech startups, and to get involved in the entrepreneurial scene in Vancouver.
  I am a British writer with experience in publishing and social enterprise. Iâ€™m
  interested in `doing good better' and joining the growing movement to
  make ethical and sustainable business the norm.
