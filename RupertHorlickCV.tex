  \maketitle

  \justify
  I am a Computer Scientist and Software Engineer with experience in functional
  programming and its mathematical foundations. I would like to bring the
  Computer Science perspective on distributed systems of information to new
  fields including, but not limited to, biology, politics, and sociology.

  \section{Experience}

    \cventry[1em]{Mar -- Sep 2017}{Software Development Engineer}{Myrtle
      Software}{}{}{Started part-time while completing my
      Masters degree and moved to full-time in June. Worked on compiling
      neural networks to FPGAs, using modern tools such as the Haskell
      programming language and the Nix build system. Joined as one of
      three developers and quickly became a leading member as the team grew.}
  
    \cventry[1em]{Summer 2016}{Research Intern}{Microsoft Research
      Cambridge}{}{}{Worked under Simon Peyton-Jones on a project to add
      functions and rich data structures to Excel. Prototyped an interesting
      new data structure and prepared demos. The demos were presented to project
      managers in Redmond and were well received.}

    \cventry[1em]{Summer 2014 \& 2015}{Software Engineering
      Intern}{Money\&Co}{}{}{Automated a large Excel financial projection in
      Java, using object-oriented functors to handle dependencies between
      calculations. The software was deployed and is now used daily by a team of
      financial analysts. Rebuilt the company website from scratch using
      Bootstrap, HTML, jQuery, Less, and Java.}

  \section{Education}

    \cventry[1em]{2016 -- 2017}{MEng Computer Science}{University of Cambridge}{}{Distinction}{
      Modules --- Category Theory, Multicore Semantics \& Programming, Advanced Functional Programming, Distributed Games \& Strategies, and Interactive Formal Verification.
      Thesis --- Formalised the theory of Generalised Species in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) using Agda. In HoTT, types have an $\infty$-groupoid structure, so we developed the theory for groupoids internally, rather than building a Category Theory library.}
    \cventry[1em]{2013 -- 2016}{BA (Hons) Computer Science}{University of Cambridge}{}{1 (81\%, Rank: 8/81)}{Dissertation --- Built the Path ORAM cryptographic primitive in OCaml on MirageOS, to allow search over encrypted documents. I analysed the performance and security properties in the 10,000 word dissertation.}
    \cventry{2007 -- 2012}{High School}{St. Paul's School}{}{}{
    \begin{tabular}{@{}ll}
      A-Level & Computing --- A$^*$, Maths --- A$^*$, Further Maths --- A$^*$, Physics --- A$^*$ \\
