  \section{Education}

    \cventry[1em]{2016 -- 2017}{MEng Computer Science}{University of Cambridge}{}{Distinction (predicted)}{
      Modules --- Category Theory, Multicore Semantics \& Programming, Advanced Functional Programming, A Mathematical Theory of Distributed Games and Strategies, and Interactive Formal Verification.\\[1em]
      Masters Thesis --- Formalised the theory of Generalised Species in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) using Agda. In HoTT, types have an $\infty$-groupoid structure, so we developed the theory for groupoids internally, rather than building a Category Theory library.}
    \cventry[1em]{2013 -- 2016}{BA (Hons) Computer Science}{University of Cambridge}{}{1 (81\%, Rank: 8/81)}{Dissertation --- Built the Path ORAM cryptographic primitive in OCaml on MirageOS, to allow search over encrypted documents. I analysed the performance and security properties in the 10,000 word dissertation.}

  \section{Experience}

    \cventry[1em]{Summer 2016}{Research Intern}{Microsoft Research Cambridge}{}{}{Worked under Simon Peyton-Jones on a project to add functions and rich data structures to Excel. I prototyped an interesting new data structure and prepared demos. The demos were presented to project managers in Redmond and were well received. I also worked on a refactoring project, which picked out common expressions in cells using anti-unification (a dual to unification), and extracted them into a new function.}
    \cventry[1em]{Summer 2015}{Software Engineering Intern}{Money\&Co}{}{}{Automated a large Excel financial projection in Java, using object-oriented functors to handle dependencies between calculations. The software was deployed and is now used daily by a team of financial analysts.}
    \cventry[1em]{Summer 2014}{Software Engineering Intern}{Money\&Co}{}{}{Rebuilt the company website from scratch using Bootstrap, HTML, jQuery, Less, and Java. I designed standards and templates to make the project maintainable and expandable.}
